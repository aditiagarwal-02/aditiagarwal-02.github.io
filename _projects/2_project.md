# Project Description

The burgeoning prevalence of lifestyle diseases necessitates innovative solutions that leverage cuttingedge
technologies to enable proactive health management. This project is dedicated to the development
of a robust data-driven machine-learning framework, harnessing the potential of wearable
activity sensors, to address the current void in comprehensive design methods, principles, and ethical
guidelines for optimizing the use of sensor data in promoting a healthy lifestyle.
• Develop an end-to-end data driven machine learning pipeline for user-specific personalized recommendations.
• Focus on four primary diseases that occur due to a sedentary lifestyle-CVD, COPD, Diabetes and obesity.
• Enable real-time user data collection using wearable activity sensors.
