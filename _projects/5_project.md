# Project Description

Today, 91% of the global population lives under unsafe levels of AQ (WHO 2021). Long-term exposure to PM2.5 increases cardiopulmonary mortality by 6–13% per 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5, which causes yearly 8 million deaths worldwide. Through this project, we aim to use a Heteroskedastic MLP which would perform spatio-temporal interpolation across the Delhi NCR region. This approach aims to capture the uncertainty in the data and thus provide a more robust interpolation while also specifying the uncertainty in the predictions. This project aims to mitigate the problem of missing data in the AQI dataset and thus provide a more robust interpolation.
