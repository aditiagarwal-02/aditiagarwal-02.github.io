# Project Description

This project focuses on doing BERT-based sentiment analysis in the context of Reddit scraping. This has been applied to analyze user comments and posts, determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with specific topics or discussions. This application is valuable for monitoring user opinions, gauging public sentiment on various subjects, and extracting meaningful information from the vast amount of textual data available on Reddit.
