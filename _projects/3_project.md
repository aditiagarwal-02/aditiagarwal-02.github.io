# Project Description

Air quality kills 7 million people worldwide every year. Brick kilns are a major source of air pollution in South Asia. This project utilizes a Brick Kilns Detector to identify brick kilns in satellite images. The detector is built using a deep learning model which takes in the coordinates and detects the brick kilns in the given area. The project leverages active learning to significantly reduce the manual annotation overhead costs and efforts. The detector is deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
