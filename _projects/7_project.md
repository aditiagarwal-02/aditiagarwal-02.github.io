# Project Description

This project focuses on doing task-specific fine-tuning of BERT. The project explores the utilization of BERT for the task of question answering on the SQuAD dataset. The project also utilizes BERT for the task of text classification on the SST-2 dataset. Through this project, we aim to explore the utilization of LLMs specific use-cases and evaluate the performance of BERT on these tasks.
