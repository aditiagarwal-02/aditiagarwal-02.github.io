# Project Description

AstroSat is India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory. It was launched on a PSLV-XL on 28 September 2015. AstroSat is a multi-wavelength astronomy satellite. The project aims to build a web-based tool for ISRO's AstroSat observations. This tool would be used to visualize the data and perform analysis on the data while identifying the sources which have been previously identified. The tool is built using Streamlit.
