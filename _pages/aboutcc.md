<em>This is supposed to be my hook statement and meant to convince you to read further.</em>

Now that you have come this far and have been hooked, let me introduce myself by saying that I am a Senior Undergraduate at IIT Gandhinagar who believes in the power of data and coding. This belief has thus fueled my interest in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

When I am not typing away on my laptop, I am an obsessive reader and a seldom writer who also likes to go on bicycle rides or play a game or two of Squash. You might as well find me engaging in friendly debates and public speaking events that tingle my opinionated brain.
